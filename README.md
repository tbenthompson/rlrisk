### Understanding

Read parts 1-3 of the intro in https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/rl_intro.html

### Setup

Clone the repo and create the `rlrisk` conda env with `conda env create`. Then install pytorch. My GPU is too old to be supported by the standard conda packages so I had to build from source (see `install_pytorch`). If you have a newer GPU, just follow the instructions on the pytorch website.
